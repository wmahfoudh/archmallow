# Archmallow
This is a n00bs collection of notes and templates related to installing Arch and customizing i3-gaps. It's not meant to be a *"yet another Arch installation tutorial"*, but rather to address a set of practical problems a beginner faces when installing Arch. This repo is mainly for personal use, however, that would be great if others can get something out of it.
