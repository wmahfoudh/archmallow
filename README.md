# Archmallow
This is a *one stop shop* n00b's collection of notes and templates related to installing Arch and customizing i3-gaps. It's not a *"yet another Arch installation tutorial"*, but rather to address a set of practical problems a beginner faces when installing Arch, in order to have a fully fuctional installation at the end of the day comparable to other distros or other operating systems. This repo is mainly for personal use, however, that would be great if others can get something out of it.
