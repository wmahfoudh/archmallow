# Archmallow
This is a personal project aiming to document and record repetitive tasks I perform whenever installing Arch on a new machine including i3 custimizations. Some of these customizations are hardware agnostic, others are matters of taste. Otherwise, if any information provided here could be of any help that would be great!
# Installation
1. [Arch Linux install](./docs/arch-install.md)
2. [Creating a new user](./docs/new-user.md)

# Other resources
1. [Useful pacman commands](./docs/useful-pacman-commands.md)
