# Archmallow
This is a n00bs collection of notes and templates related to installing Arch and customizing i3-gaps. It's not meant to be a *"yet another Arch installation tutorial"*, but rather to address a set of practical problems a beginner faces when installing Arch and i3-gaps. This repo is mainly for personal use, hopefully somebody else could find something useful here
