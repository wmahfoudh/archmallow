# Archmallow
This is an n00bs collection of info related to installing Arch and customizing i3-gaps along with my personal templates. This aims to document and record in one place various tasks performed whenever installing and doing customization on a new machine. Some of these customizations are hardware agnostic, others are matters of taste. Otherwise, if any information provided here could be of any help that would be great!
